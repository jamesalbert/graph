This is a toy plotting library, written in [nim](http://nim-lang.org) and based on nimage.  
The end goal is to have a tiny plotting lib to include in [inim](https://github.com/stisa/INim)  
Outputs a `.png` file.

A copy of [npng](https://github.com/stisa/npng) is required for this to work.
( Just clone npng and then run `nimble install` in npng folder )
  
Some examples:

### Example 1
